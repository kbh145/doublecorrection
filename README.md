# Doubly-corrected robust standard errors for GMM 

STATA code for Doubly Corrected Robust Variance Estimator for Linear GMM as in Hwang, Kang, and Lee (2019, Working Paper), Hansen and Lee (2019, Working Paper) 

This implements robust-standard error of one-step (2SLS), two-step, and iterated-GMM and provides finite sample corrections in addition to the well-known Windmeijer (2005, Journal of Econometrics) and conventional (heteroskedasticity-robust) standard error. Further, reported standard error is also valid under general model misspecification (e.g., invalid instruments, misspecified lag specifications, heterogeneous effects, etc).

**_dcxtab.ado_** : Stata code for implementing doubly-corrected robust variance estimator in dynamic panel data setup. Usage of command is similar to xtabond2.
